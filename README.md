## Status Legend

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **yes** | Run on Wayland natively without any configuration |
| **yes*** | Can work on Wayland natively, but need some tinkering with the environment variables |
| **no** | Require XWayland to run |

## Environment Variables

You need to install the sdl2 package on your distro before doing this.

| Launcher | How to find it |
|----------|----------------|
| Steam | Library > Properties > Launch options > Add environment variables before `%command%` |
| Heroic game Launcher | Library > Settings > Environment Variables |

### SDL_VIDEODRIVER

To run an SDL2 application on Wayland, set `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` 

### SDL_DYNAMIC_API
`SDL_DYNAMIC_API` override the SDL library used by a particular game. Useful if the game use a old version without Wayland support.

Fedora, Arch: `SDL_DYNAMIC_API=/usr/lib64/libSDL2-2.0.so`

Flatpak: `SDL_DYNAMIC_API="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0"`
